# Hugging Face Machine Learning for Audio Study Group

Welcome to the ML for Audio Study Group. Through a series of presentations, paper reading and discussions, we'll explore the field of applying Machine Learning in the Audio domain. Some examples of this are:
* Generating synthetic sound out of a given text (think of conversational assistants)
* Transcribing audio signals to text.
* Removing noise out of an audio.
* Separating different sources of audio.
* Identifying which speaker is talking.
* And much more!

We suggest you to join the community Discord at http://hf.co/join/discord, and we're looking forward to meet at the #ml-4-audio-study-group channel.
